    "## Why Use Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are a convenient way to store related information. Lists are essentially ordered sequences of items, and these items can be of any type you wish, and can even mix different types of data, making them very versatile objects. A Python list is much like a mathematical matrix, except that the entries can contain objects that are not numbers.\n",

Each of these options is separated by a colon (:), and they are all optional. However, when left out, it has a very specific meaning. The trickiest thing to remember is that the end value is actually the first number that is NOT included in the selected slice. Check out the examples below and their meaning."
