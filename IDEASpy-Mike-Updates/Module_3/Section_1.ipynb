    "The widely used module NumPy is optimized for mathematical operations on arrays of values. NumPy's core is written in C, which means the NumPy lists are actually C-arrays. They are static and typed, unlike almost all objects in pure Python, such as lists (recall that a single list could include many different types of objects). NumPyâ€™s core math functions are optimized to work extremely quickly over data arrays, and their inputs can be arrays of any number of dimensions. The NumPy module does more than just arrays, such as providing functions for timing the execution of blocks of code, which we'll turn to in the next lesson.\n",
