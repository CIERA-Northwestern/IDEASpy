    "# 1.1 | Getting Started with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. The goal was to create a language what was easy to learn, easy to read, and that could accomplish complicated tasks with very few lines of code. Python has quickly become one of the most popular coding languages when computing in scientific and many other industries. Perhaps most importantly, there are tons of libraries (sets of pre-written functions) that have been developed for Python. Often, the best way to accomplish a coding task is to simply find the library that has already solved the task for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "But to be able to leverage all that Python offers, you must start with the basics. As you go through this course, we'll provide you with lots of exercises to complete, both inside the actual course pages, as well as programs you'll need to build on your own computer. Two very important points we want to make at the outset:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. When learning to code, it's important to actually do it! It's easy to simply look at code and say to yourself, \"yeah, that makes sense, I think I've got it!\" But seeing it and doing it are two very different things. Trust us!\n",
    "\n",
    ">2. We obviously cannot cover everything in this course, so if there's ever something that you don't completely get, or that you're interested in learning more about, look it up! Google things liberally and shamelessly, because there are tons of excellent Python resources out there. Reviewing different tutorials, examples, and forums will help you become familiar with the language more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Makings of a Program\n",
    "\n",
    "The details look different in every language, but most programs include these basic elements\n",
    "> - __Input:__ Read in data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device\n",
    "> - __Output:__ Display information on the screen, send it to a file or other device\n",
    "> - __Math:__ Perform mathematical operations (like addition, multiplication, trigonometric functions) or more complex ones (like fancy statistical calculations)\n",
    "> - __Conditional Execution:__ Check for certain conditions to be met (e.g., if x is equal to 5) and execute a certain sequence of statements (commonly referred to as if-then statements)\n",
    "> - __Repetition:__ Perform some action repeatedly using loops, such as summing up all the numbers in a column of data\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go through the rest of this module, we'll cover all of these basic elements of a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Ways to Use Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is no one-trick pony! There are several different methods for coding in Python. We'll learn about three of them in this course. Note that JupyterLab allows you to use each method in the same place!\n",
    "\n",
    "> - __Interactive Mode:__ This method allows you to run Python code in the command line, line-by-line.\n",
    "> - __Standalone code written in a text editor:__ With this method, you will create a full program and execute the code all at once.\n",
    "> - __Jupyter Notebooks:__ This is an interactive environment in which you can keep many different codes together in a notebook of sorts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start working with notebooks since we are already in one!\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start learning is by jumping right into an interactive session, where you get to see the results of the code you enter immediately. Ready to go?"

Note, the object can be a number, a string (any sequence of characters), or other data type (and you'll learn about many more data types later in the course). The sample code below shows some examples of assignments to variables. Note the use of the single quotes around the string in the second example. Without the quotes, the string grapes would be interpreted as a variable, which would return an error, as no such variable has been assigned.\n",

You may have notice that in this example we have multiplied integers by floats. 10 is an integer and apple is a float because of how we assigned its value.
