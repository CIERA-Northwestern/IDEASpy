    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "We've briefly covered input, output, and calculations, but often we need our code to perform some decision making, just like we have to do each day in real life (if it's cold outside, take a coat; if it's warm, leave the coat at home). These conditionals come in the form of \"if statements\" which can range in complexity (for example, some applications might call for several, or \"nested\", statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of if statements as asking your computer whether something is True of False (these being the two \"Boolean operators\"). The most common type of numerical questions or checks that you'll be doing are the comparison operators, >, <, and ==, so we'll cover those as well (note that since the single = is reserved for assignment of variables when checking for equality, Python uses ==).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of an If statement\n",

    "An if statement typically has two parts: the condition (what is being checked each time) and the action (what is being performed if the condition is met). In general, an if statement will look something like this:\n",
