    "## Why Use Lists?\n",
    "We briefly touched on lists in [Module 1: Section 4](https://github.com/bueno646/CIERA-HS-Program-2021/blob/master/IDEASpy-Mike-Updates/Module_1/Section_4.ipynb). We likened them to a [row of lockers](https://previews.123rf.com/images/elfachero3/elfachero31803/elfachero3180300002/97960122-row-of-tan-school-lockers.jpg) to convey that lists are a way to store multiple pieces of information in Python. Here we will provide a more technical description and expand on the utility of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are a convenient way to store related information. Lists are essentially ordered sequences of items, and the items (or \"elements\") within a list can be of any type you wish, and can even mix different types of data, making them very versatile objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s start with the very basics of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Changing Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list, put the items inside of square brackets separated by commas, as shown in the examples below.\n"
