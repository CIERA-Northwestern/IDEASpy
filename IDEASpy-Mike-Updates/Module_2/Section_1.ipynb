    "## Why Use Lists?\n",
    "We briefly touched on lists in [Module 1: Section 4](https://github.com/bueno646/CIERA-HS-Program-2021/blob/master/IDEASpy-Mike-Updates/Module_1/Section_4.ipynb). We likened them to a labeled ice cube tray to convey that lists are a way to store multiple pieces of information in Python. Here we will provide a more technical description and expand on the utility of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are a convenient way to store related information. Lists are essentially ordered sequences of items, and the items (or \"elements\") within a list can be of any type you wish, and can even mix different types of data, making them very versatile objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s start with the very basics of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Changing Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a list, put the items inside of square brackets separated by commas, as shown in the examples below.\n"

    "It is often helpful to make sure your code looks the way you want it to. If you are working with lists, one way to do that is to make sure it is composed of as many elements as you need it to be! For example, if I am storing the temperature of 5 stars for later use, I may want to check that the list if 5 elements long. Incorporating checks like this in your code can be very helpful for avoiding (and finding) bugs in your code. "

    "When you take a slice of a list, you have three options you can control: the start index, the end index (which is non-inclusive in the slice), and a \"step value\", which controls how you want to step over the items included in your slice (one by one, every other, etc.). Each of these options is separated by a colon (:), and they are all optional. However, when left out, it has a very specific meaning. The trickiest thing to remember is that the end value is actually the first number that is NOT included in the selected slice. Check out the examples below and their meaning. Below you will see an example that uses the words \"start index\", \"end index\", and \"step value\" instead of numbers, which will be in the following code block.<br>\n",
