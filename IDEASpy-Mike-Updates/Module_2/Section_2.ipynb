    "In Module 1, you learned to construct while loops to repeat a sequence of steps until some condition is met, such as passing through the loop a fixed number of times, e.g., while x < 10. Another way to repeat a sequence of steps is through a for loop, in which you iterate over a predefined sequence, such as a Python list. The general structure for a for loop is as follows:\n",
