    "\n",
    "One of the key selling points of using Python is its versatility. Python comes pre-packaged with many built-in modules and functions that are handy when doing computational research. These include tools for handling file input and output, performing operations on strings, performing standard mathematical operations and doing many other common things. One module you'll use frequently is the math module, which makes it possible for you to compute trigonometric functions, factorials and logarithms, as well as accessing special numbers, like pi and infinity. With Python, you've got just about everything you need at your fingertips!\n",

    "So what exactly is the difference between a function, a module and a package?\n",
    "\n",
    "> - A function is a block of code that can be referenced and run from anywhere in your program<br>\n",
    "> - A module is a text file that contains a number of functions and other items<br>\n",
    "> - A package is a group of related modules<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through the course, you'll learn many more useful built-in functions, modules and packages. You'll also find that sometimes you need to define your own functions and modules to suit your specific needs, so we'll show you how to do that, too. To explore all the included functions in Python 3, check out the documentation __[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)__.\n",

    "### Some Built-in Functions\n",
    "Many useful functions are built-in and can be used right away. Some common examples include,\n",

    "> max(num1, num2, num3) : returns the max of all items included in the list<br>\n",
    "> range(n_max) : returns the list of numbers from 0 up to n_max-1<br>\n",

    "While python comes with many useful pre-packaged modules, they are not automatically imported into your program - this must be done manually with each python program or each interactive python session. So, with every new interactive session, or every new program you create, the modules you need must be imported first, using a simple command of import MODULENAME \n",

    "As you begin writing your own code to solve specific research problems, you'll find that sometimes your research will call for very specialized functions that only you (and maybe a handful of other people) will need.

Later in the course, you'll learn how creating your own modules can help you keep your growing collection of codes modular and organized.\n",
