# IDEASpy

A beginner Python course tailored to those intereseting in scientific computing and data science. The course is presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Each module introduces a new larger topic in python, as well as at least one challenge set at the completion of training modules. The modules cover the following basic topics:

1. Introduction to Python
	1. Getting start with Python
	2. Data Types and Precision
	3. Functions, Modules, Packages
	4. Conditional Statements and Loops
	5. Your first Python code
	* Challenge 1: Using Python to Analyze Seismic Data on Mars

2. Introduction to Data and Plotting in Python

Funding for the creation of this course was provided by the National Science Foundation NRT Program and the IDEAS program within CIERA at Northwestern University.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
