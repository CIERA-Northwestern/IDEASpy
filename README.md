# IDEASpy

A beginner Python course tailored to those intereseting in scientific computing and data science. The course is presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Each module introduces a new larger topic in python, as well as at least one challenge set at the completion of training modules. The modules cover the following basic topics:

1. Introduction to Python
	1. Getting start with Python
	2. Data Types and Precision
	3. Functions, Modules, Packages
	4. Conditional Statements and Loops
	5. Your first Python code
	* Challenge 1: Using Python to Analyze Seismic Data on Mars

2. Introduction to Data and Plotting in Python
	1. Lists in Python
	2. Loops and List Comprehension
	3. Reading and Parsing Data From a File
	4. Defining Your Own Functions and Modules
	5. Plotting with Matplotlib
	* Challenge 2: Using Python to Analyze and Plot Exoplanet Data

3. Optimizing Python and Furthering Analysis in Python
	1. NumPy
	2. Code Optimization
	3. Pandas Basics
	4. Exploring More Complex Data Files with Pandas
	* Challenge 3: Optimize a Code with NumPy
	* Challenge 4: Analyze Gaia Data with Pandas


Funding for the creation of this course was provided by the National Science Foundation through a combination of the IDEAS and Reach for the Stars Programs within CIERA at Northwestern University. 

## Getting Started

These programs can be run through jupyter notebook on your local machine or Google colab on a web browzer. It is recommended to use Google colab if you are uncertain about installing python/anaconda, or if this is for a class on general computers.

Follow these instructions if you want to run this on Google colab. It is required that you have an email address that is hosted through Google in order to save you work for later. 

1. Go to Google Colab: [Colab](https://colab.research.Google.com/)

2. Click **File -> Open notebook**

3. Click **Github**. Copy and paste this link: https://github.com/CIERA-Northwestern/IDEASpy. Click enter or return. 

4. Click on the Module/Section you would like to work on. 

5. Click **Copy to Drive**

6. Make sure you work in this new copy if you would like to save your work!

To run locally, we will provide instructions using the **Terminal**. We generally recommend installing Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda. To install Anaconda on your local machine, please follow these instructions: [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Change directory to the preferred directory where you would like these notebooks stored
```
cd Path/To/Directory/
```

3. Clone this repository in the terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/CIERA-Northwestern/IDEASpy.git
```

4. Change directory to the IDEASpy directory
```
cd IDEASpy/
```

5. Change directory to the module of your choice. For example, for Module 1:
```
cd Module_1/
```

6. Start jupyter notebook with the desired section. For example, for Section 1:
```
jupyter notebook Section_1.ipynb
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
